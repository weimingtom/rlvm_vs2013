# rlvm_vs2013
rlvm windows port for vs2013, not good, only for backup  
NOTE: Uncompress include.zip, lib.zip and vendor.zip before open vs2013/rlvm.sln with VS2013      

## Test command line  
* --game-root "F:\work_rlvm\kanon_se_ori"  

## Test game data  
KANON_SE and Planetarian are OK.    
If you like, you can buy Planetarian from Steam store, I prefer English version.
